##  LendThings ##
**MyThings** is a site people who want to borrow something from a friend for rare occasions they need something they do not have.

### Summary ###
Keep a list of what you own by category, have access to what other people have in their inventories and be able to borrow something they have on rare occasions you need something once. The site allows you to keep an inventory list for yourself and also enter a date of purchase/opening that is available on-the-go. See what you have so you don't buy double or to check a version/model when buying parts. Find out if a friend has something you can borrow.

### Problem ###
Buying the same thing again and again. Spending money on things you only need once. Don't actually know what you have and what you don't.

### Solution ###
This site serves as an inventory site and also a site for you to see if someone you know can lend you what you need.

### Quote from Spokesperson ###
"Using this site not only helped me become more aware of the things I own, but also about being a better consumer. I now have access to what I have available on-the-go and also what I can borrow from a friend for things I only need to use one or two times" -- Doris Chiu, Developer at LendThings

### How to Get Started ###
Three simple steps to get started:
  1) Sign up for an account
  2) Log things you own in your inventory
  3) Pull up the site anytime you are buying something, need something you don't have or want to see what you already have at home.

### Customer Quote ###
'This site helped me become a more conscious consumer. I'm able to avoid buying something that I already have in storage and avoid finding duplicates of things during the annual spring clean. I also no longer feel obligated to buy something that's only going to be used once. It makes lending from friends easier as my friends don't need to spend the time looking through their own things. Great for people that want to avoid spending money unnecessarily' -- Mia Corgilicious
